          <p>Humans are on the same boat,</p>
          <p>They call it society.</p>

          <p>What if I use poison</p>

          <p>Today I'm embracing the angels,</p>
          <p>I was craving for their lights long gone.</p>
          <p>I saw demons behind people,</p>
          <p>They were covering hope.</p>
          <p>Not everyone could see them,</p>
          <p>Those children were picky,</p>
          <p>They liked to play with the less powerful.</p>
          <p>I was a perfect target who lasted long</p>
          <p>We played together forever.</p>
          <p>I thought they were gonna leave</p>
          <p>So I tried to please them.</p>
          <p>Every day was like hell,</p>

          <h2>Traveling through the fields</h2>
          <p>
            Little man had a question for his Mama while they were walking
            through the fields. The plants surrounding their way were twice the
            boy's height, and as he looked up to the mother, he saw the sunbeams
            illuminating her face, while he was shielded.
          </p>
          <p>"Where are we going?'' he asked like any kid would on a trip.</p>
          <p>
            She kept quiet. The sound of their feet on the ground was
            comforting, like a rhythm keeping track of their thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while staring back at the yellow light like she was
            battling, looking for an answer to her own questions behind a
            blinding reality, she finally got a glimpse of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>"We're looking for home, honey. We're looking for home."</p>
          <p>She said it with less furrowed eyebrows, now watching the road.</p>
          <p>
            ''But isn't home where we were ? Aren't we supposed to be there ?
            With our family and our... everyday ?" The little man asked again.
          </p>
          <p>
            A weak force was pulling back at the knot where their hands united.
            The boy's tilted head towards the sky was making him slow down, so
            she finally lowered her gaze to his sweet face and said with the
            cousin of a smile:
          </p>
          <p>
            "We're always where we're supposed to be, baby. Might it be a road
            or a house, by the lake or by the sea. It's good. It's always good.
            Even if your feet hurt from walking."
          </p>
          <p>
            The kid's face scrunched in a ball of wonder and distractedness, and
            they kept on walking.

          <p>- What now! You're saying I only see what I want to see?</p>
          <p>- Yes. Don't we all?</p>
          <p>
            - If it was true then I would choose to not see the ugliness in this
            world.
          </p>
          <p>- I don't think so.</p>
          <p>
            - And why is that? Who wants to see hunger, death, poverty, cruelty,
            stupidity, savageness?
          </p>
          <p>
            - Logically, no one wants to see all that. But what if it excused
            our own ugliness. You would accept the world's bad sides, so that
            you could accept yourself. You'd only see the bad in you otherwise.
            She kept quiet.
          </p>
          <p>
            - You'd say ''It's the way it is'' and you'd be right, he continued.

          <p>- Oh me?! I see a cat.</p>
