        <h3>All together now</h3>
        <p>
          All together now is a drama movie that revolves around Amber, who is
          an over-optimistic, joyful and volunteer teenager but surrounded with
          countless problems. She’s an orphan from her dad’s side and since then
          it was as if she was drowning in a whirl of sadness. From afar, you
          could swear that her life was normal or even perfect but the truth is
          that besides all the things that were happening to her she stayed
          strong no matter what and continued to fight, she was living in a car
          bus, a thief stole her father’s belongings, and her mom went to live
          in the house of a drunk psychopath and violent man, and still moved to
          her friend’s home. Yet, the straw that broke the camel's back was her
          mother’s death, she entered a phase of depression where she was
          rejecting all kinds of help, she stopped school and did all sorts of
          odd jobs to pay for her dog’s surgery because he fell sick.
          Nevertheless, her entourage was aware that this wasn’t the real her
          and they supported her to get through this. The woman that assisted
          her the most was an old lady from the nursing home she was a volunteer
          at. This film teaches us that even in the darkest moments, you are
          never truly alone and that all the good deeds that you do will be
          returned to you.

        <h3>Amélie Poulain</h3>
        <p>
          Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain (the Fabulous Destiny of Amélie
          Poulain) embodies the art of seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary.
          The entire film is based on this contrast between the banality of the
          events reported and the originality with which Jean Pierre Jeunet
          treats them. Basically, the viewer follows the exterior and interior
          life of Amélie Poulain, a young, solitary and introverted bar
          waitress. He attends her meetings, her relations; terribly banal, but
          at the same time terribly exciting. The protagonist's neuroses, hopes
          and thoughts, as harmless as possible, turn into scenes that are
          sometimes touching, sometimes hilarious.
        </p>
        <p>
          The characters in the film could be those we meet every day in the
          street, and yet this film is the occasion for a lucid and complex
          analysis of social ties. Absolutely everything contributes to
          transforming everyday life into great cinema scenes: from multiple
          historical and cinematographic references to this inquisitive
          voice-over.
        </p>
        <p>
          The life of Amélie Poulain takes on the aspect of a modern tale that
          is punchy with humour and overflowing with fantasy; a lively and
          sparkling storey thanks to the delicacy of the dialogues and the
          photography; a story with magnificent sepia tones and memorable music
          (I'm not a fan of piano, and yet ...).
        </p>
        <p>
          It's hard to find a more endearing character than Amélie, this kind of
          discreet and shy personality with whom we immediately identify, as she
          sends us back our own reflection or the image of a known person, whose
          social isolation isn't equal to inner fantasy. A character whose life
          forms the basis of the film, whose depths of psychology are made known
          to the viewer by a host of visual and sound techniques. The
          opportunity to experience a multitude of emotions, at the same time as
          to reflect on themes such as those of exclusion, difference or social
          malaise, to try to answer this eternal question: "what to succeed in
          life? ".
        </p>
        <p>
          By a kind of "mise en abyme" (the scenes in which Amélie watches her
          life on television bring us back to our image as a viewer watching the
          film), thanks to the identification with the character and this
          incessant sublimation of everyday life, Jeunet manages to release a
          thesis of this poll story: life is the greatest of adventures; As
          Hippolyte said in this movie: "life is just the endless repetition of
          a performance that will never take place", so let's take advantage of
          it and live the moment. Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain is an
          underestimated film in France but recognized internationally. A
          cinematographic poem that reaches a stage close to perfection; we
          watch it without seeing the time pass, and long afterwards reconsider
          the depth of its message, the beauty of such a scene, while whistling
          the melodies of the soundtrack. A work overflowing with fantasy,
          humour, lyricism, lightness and humanism, a unique moment of cinema at
          the same time as a beautiful hymn to life, to brotherhood .... And
          that's why I love this film so much.
